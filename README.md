# PlanAway Vacation Planning Site
Milestone Project Two: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Insitute

The site allows the users to begin to plan their vacation through the search and map tools embedded in the web page. They can select from one of the top 20 most visited countires in the world, then narrow down their search to a city or town within that country. There are 4 selectors once the search is complete which will bring up related results. For further information on the selected country the country info button will reveal useful information appropriate for planning a trip.

### UX 
--- 
My goal for the overall design of the site was to implement a soft and warm feel, with clean and clear breaks between content. The set up of the content allows the user to easily flow through and achieve their desiared goals. I kept the structure simple to allow more enphasis on the functionality of the site. 

I decided to create a two page site, with an initial landing page and a main page (planner.html), which contains all the functionality. I felt this made the project feel more like a realistic web site and not just a project. 

The landing page contains the created site heading and logo which runs through all the site. There is brief information on to the basics of the page, there is then a carousel of images based on the user potential search results. the footer is very simple and points to the API used for the site with a link to that page (Google). I felt this was a very appealing visual for users as they enter the site, it also allows them a brief moment to take in the sites basic functions before heading to the main page.
